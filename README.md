My Strengths 

I can learn and grow. I strive to learn and be a better version of myself in life and my work. 
I don't take failure as a negative thing but as an entry to improvement and evolving from a challenge.
Time Management is something I do not struggle with, I'm always using my time to do something productive in a reasonable amount of time, and this is something I've developed throughout my career. 

My Values 

Protecting people. I grew up in a foreign household so working around the internet was foreign and knowing that I can be there to help protect someone unfamiliar with the internet and malware that may occur is a goal of mine. 
Adhering Laws. 
Being able to handle information properly and effectively protect the organization from those who aren't adhering to the laws.  

Why Cybersecurity

Being able to protect people on the internet from behind the scenes is something I'm passionate about, especially since what I've mentioned before growing up in a foreign household where knowing about harm on the internet was never a thought. 
Knowing I can protect others from harm is something I am and will be proud to honor every day. 
I'm passionate and provide my 100% in everything I do without any question. 
I've always been a natural leader and provide efficiency in my work. 
I believe the values and strengths I have and strive to gain throughout my career will meet the security goals of any organization.
